# Error Handling in Table Component

`TableError` appears to be a dediacted component for handling error display in the table interface

```jsx
<TableError error={error}>
```

1. It' s a specialized component solely responsible for displaying error messages to users

2. It receives the `error` state as a prop

3. It likely conditionally renders some error UI when the `error` prop is not null.

The seperation of component follows the practices of:

- Using props to pass erro state
- Implementing conditional rendering to show/hide the error message
